# Mrtn-LoadingScreen

Go to the index.html and lines 11 through 24 are config lines. On line 11, you can change the loading background, by changing the "bg1" to any of the pictures listed in the images folder of the assets. 

For music, drop a .mp3 in the music folder in assets and then go to line 12 and change "assets/music/YOURSONGHERE.mp3" to whatever your mp3 file is. 

For your logo, drop a .png version of your logo into the images folder, where you got the background, and name it "logo.png". You will not have to change anything in the index.html unless you name your logo picture something else.

For lines 17 & 18, you can change those to say anything you'd like. They are completly flexible and you don't have to put anything in the assets folder, as they are just text boxes. 

For line 21, you can change the "WELCOME" message to whatever you'd like, but I like it how it is currently. 

If you have any other questions, DM my discord: martin_519 or just add me and talk then. 

Thank you for using my loading screen on your FiveM Server!
